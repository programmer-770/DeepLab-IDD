# DeepLab-IDD
Modified DeepLab V3+ architecture for semantic segmentation on IDD

# Dependencies
We have used <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow">TensorFlow's</a> 2 research models, namely <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/deeplab">Deeplab</a> & <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/slim">Slim</a>, to perform Semantic Segmentation on the <a href="https://idd.insaan.iiit.ac.in/">Indian Driving Dataset</a>.

[@tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/deeplab](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/deeplab) is used to perform Semantic Segmentation task.

[@tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/slim](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/slim) is used for some functions in deeplab code.
