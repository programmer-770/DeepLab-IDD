# DeepLab-IDD
Modified DeepLab V3+ architecture for semantic segmentation on IDD

# Dependencies
We have used [TensorFlow's](https://github.com/tensorflow) 2 research models, namely [Deeplab](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/deeplab) & [Slim](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/slim), to perform Semantic Segmentation on the [Indian Driving Dataset](https://idd.insaan.iiit.ac.in/).

[@tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/deeplab](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/deeplab) is used to perform Semantic Segmentation task.

[@tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/slim](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/slim) is used for some functions in deeplab code.
